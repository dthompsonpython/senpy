# senpy
Notice me, Senpy

Senpy is a testing framework for learning how to write modules from scratch. You write, you test, and you write again.
Running Senpy will test your code, and delete it for you. Put your code in the dojo, and try to pass the tests!

# Instructions

You can run the tests using "python senpy <testname>" in the root directory. It'll run the test suite in tests/<testname>, and then delete the code in dojo/dojo.py. The idea is that you write the appropriate code for the test in dojo.py, run the tests, and rewrite it until you get it right.
  
### Example:

'''python senpy.py examples'''
  
## Why do my things get deleted?

The best way to get better at coding is to... code a lot. I usually don't get things right the first time I write them, and I'd like to get to the point where I can do things like implement a graph or red / black tree correctly the first time without screwing up syntax or forgetting things. This will help build that muscle memory and test retention
